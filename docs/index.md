**Flashnotes is a desktop application for managing and revising your study materials through flash cards.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Flashnotes, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Flashnotes, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
