### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/flashnotes/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects and general data within FlashNotes in json format.
* can read back data in json save file on next initialization of FlashNotes.
* can update save file's data during execution of a valid command entered by the user.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.flashnotes.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* NUS FASS student who likes to write down lecture notes
* practices active learning techniques via flash cards
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage, read and create flashcards faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample flashcards. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a card

1. Deleting a card while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all cards using the `list` command. Multiple cards in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First card is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted card shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No card is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Finding cards by tag
1. Finding cards via a specific tag

    1. Prerequisites: Flashnotes have cards containing tag 'Singapore' and 'Malaysia'

    1. Test case: `listTags Singapore Malaysia` <br>
       Expected: All cards with the tag 'Singapore' and cards with the tag 'Malaysia' will be shown.
